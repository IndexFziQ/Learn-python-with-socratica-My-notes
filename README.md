# Learn-python-with-socratica-My-notes

My notes about "Learn python with socratica" — a lesson from youtube.

I convert the details from the video to the codes with the help of ipython and describe it in chinese way.

Maybe it has many mistakes. If you find an error, please contact me by issues or email.

At last, the project’s content will be published on the my blog: *indexfziq.github.io*.
